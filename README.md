# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm Travis, a full stack web and native iOS developer from Nashville ðŸ¤ , TN USA.

I'm passionate about software creating better experiences for everyone in this world. I love building well thought out, well designed, intuitive and beautiful experiences for people. This makes me a tinkerer at heart who loves to play with things and constantly iterate. This is probably why I am also a certified scrum master.

### Projects I Am Proud Of:

#### Daily Dashboard ![Swift Logo](./swift-brands.svg =25x)

This is a little tvOS app I wrote to better understand network calls in Swift. The great thing about tvOS is its UI limitations. It's always a 16:9 aspect ratio and always landscape mode so for someone new to Swift and iOS development, it was a great entrÃ© to dive in with. The app gets a background image from a curated list of National Parks via the Unsplash API, it displays the weather from OpenWeather and displays the current time.

#### HeyBurrito! ![React Logo](https://github.com/travisbrigman/travisbrigman/blob/main/react-brands.svg =25x)

This is the capstone project I did for my client-side learning at Nashville Software School. So it was my first foray into React. The idea was to create a way for my favorite burrito shop in town to take online orders. So a user can build an order and send it to the queue. From there an employee view allows a person to manage the queue and e-mail items (presumably to a printer). As said, the app was written in React using the Grommet CSS-in-JS framework. The backend is just a little JSON sever file.
